# Terra OS

![terra](pxe/splash.png)

Modern, minimal operating system (we've heard that before) optimized for containers within the Stellar Project.

Terra is an OS not a distro, we use the best distribution for the job, and that's an Ubuntu base.

This repo is a mono repo for most, if not all terra && stellar projects.

## Status

**Project Status:** alpha

* alpha - APIs will change, not ready services.
* beta - APIs may change, can run services.
* production - APIs stable, can run services.


## Build Terra

If you don't have a kernel built then do so first:

```bash
> make kernel
```

Now build the terra base images and components:

```bash
> make release
```

To make the terra binaries locally and install them do:

```bash
> make local && sudo make install
```

## Installation

### PXE

For running in a PXE environment terra has a controller with `tftp` and `iscsi` support.

To install the files for PXE run:

```bash
> sudo terra -r registry.compute:5000 --http pxe install
```

To save your node image in pxe run:

```bash
> terra pxe save server.toml
```

This will generate the pxe config for the node's information.

### Disk

Make sure you have a disk partitioned with one partition when installing terra.
You need to have this done before using the terra command to install the image to the device.
Use `fdisk` here to do so.

To install your image onto a disk, run the following.

To install onto an iscsi volume:

```bash
> sudo terra -r registry.compute:5000 --http  install --os /dev/sdb1
```

If you have a separate data LUN use `--data <device>` for it.

You will need to save the nodes PXE config with the `save` config.

## Boot

Now boot your node and PXE will take care of the rest.
